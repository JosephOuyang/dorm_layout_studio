# Dorm Layout Studio

Dorm Layout Studio is an interactive 2D dorm room designer built for the CMU 15-112 environment using `cmu_graphics` and `cmu_cpcs_utils`. The app lets users choose between three preset room layouts (Single, Double, and Triple) inspired by real McGill House and Morewood Gardens floor plans, and then design their space by placing, moving, and rotating furniture within those rooms. Doors, windows, and labeled dimension lines in feet and inches give each layout a realistic feel and help users reason about the actual size of the space they are designing.

Furniture is managed through a palette on the right side of the design screen, which includes beds, closets, and desks. To add a piece of furniture to the room, the user clicks and drags from the palette into the room; a quick click without dragging will not keep the piece. Once furniture is in the room, clicking a piece selects it so it can be dragged or rotated, and pressing `r` rotates the selected item 90 degrees clockwise around its center. While a piece is selected, a colored “ghost” rectangle is drawn over it: green indicates a valid placement (the furniture is fully inside the room and not overlapping other items), while red indicates an invalid position. If the user releases a newly spawned piece in an invalid location, that piece is removed; if an existing piece is dragged into an invalid location and released, it snaps back to its original position, size, and orientation. A trash can in the bottom-right corner of the screen allows the user to delete furniture by dragging and releasing a piece over the trash area.

The app also includes a dedicated measurement mode accessible via the RULER panel in the bottom-left corner. Clicking the panel toggles measurement mode on and off, with a green border indicating that measurement mode is active. In this mode, the user can click once inside the room to set a starting point and click again to set an ending point, creating a saved measurement segment. A preview line displays continuously updated distances as the mouse moves, and all reported distances are converted from pixels into real-world inches and feet based on the chosen layout’s known width and height. A short on-screen hint can appear near the most recent segment, and measurement mode can be exited at any time by pressing `esc` or clicking the small `X` in the corner of the RULER panel.

Undo and redo support is provided through a snapshot-based history system that tracks furniture moves, rotations, deletions, and measurement segments. The user can undo and redo changes using the keyboard shortcuts `z` (Undo) and `y` (Redo) or by using the arrow buttons located under the “Back to Layouts” button. These buttons are visually disabled (grayed out) when an action is not available to undo or redo, giving clear feedback about the current history state. Navigation between screens is straightforward: the app opens on a Home screen with a “Let’s Design!” button, then moves to a layout selection screen where the user picks Single, Double, or Triple, and finally transitions to the design screen. From the layout selection screen, the user can return to the Home screen, and from the design screen, the user can return to the layout selection screen using “Back to Layouts.”

To run Dorm Layout Studio, you will need Python 3.x (tested with Python 3.10+ / 3.11+), along with the `cmu_graphics` and `cmu_cpcs_utils` modules as used in the 15-112 course environment. At the top of the main file, the typical imports are:

```python
from cmu_graphics import *
from cmu_cpcs_utils import *
